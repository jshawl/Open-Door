# Feedback

## Project Workflow

**Meets Expectations**

Excellent comments in the Readme and user stories on Trello! In the future, please include
set up instructions for your application. This will be useful to future you and potential technical
employers / interviewers who are not familiar with rails.

## Technical Requirements

**Meets Expectations**

In the future, I recommend adding in a social feature like following providers/seekers
or messaging. This will allow you to practice many-to-many associations and creating
join tables.

## Creativity / Interface

Nice to see you implemented bootstrap well. I left a comment in your scss file
linking to a recommended article. It might also be worth checking in with one of the
UX designers. They just finished code week - you could trade help with them!

## Deployment and Functionality

After signing up, I was surprised to see I could edit existing providers and seekers.
